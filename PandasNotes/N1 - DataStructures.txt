** Data Structures in Python Pandas =>
     The pandas provides three data structures for processing the data.
     Series & dataframes And pannel
    
    Series => 1D array for storing various data types.
    
              import pandas as pandas;
              a = pd.Series()
              print(a)

              # we can change index according to ourselves ,by using index= fxn 
              # we can change the datatype using dtype function.
              # we can give a Name parameter to our data by which data will be given a name
              # We can use any type of data types or data sets in Series Dataset

             dict = {"name":["Ayush","Dave","Ram"],"pop":[1,2,5,6],"Rank":[1,4,3,5]}

             # when we use mix data, dType will be 'object'd
             # We can make a Series from a single data
             # We can make a Series fo multiple block by a Single Data, we just have to give indices
             # when we addon both series the task will be performed, jese 4 tak k data equal h to 4 tak addOn ho jayenge and baki none de dega
            # but in num py it will give a broadcast error
            # Panda missing data k sath v task perform krta hai.

    
    Dataframes =>
              2D array for storing various data types.

              import pandas as pandas;
              a = pd.DataFrame()
              print(a)

              # For creating data frames we need lists or Dict :
              # Imp = when we are passin data from dictionary the length of all data should be same or error will show
              # when we need a Particular column then we uses "column" attribute
              # we can change index of the dataframe by using 'index=[]' parameter.
              # get a Particular value for DataFrame:  just like arrays
              # Creating Dataframe form multiple lists =>

             list_1 = [[11,22,33,44],[55,66,77,88],[101,102,103,104],[1.0,1.2,1.3,1.4]]
            #Creating DataFrame from a Series =:
    
            sr = {"ayush":pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5]),"Dave":pd.Series([11,22,33,44,55]),"Sara":pd.Series(['s','d','g','h','j'])}




** Arithmetic Operations => 

1. Column-wise Operations :

You can directly perform arithmetic on DataFrame columns =>

Example:

df["Sum"] = df["A"] + df["B"]
df["Diff"] = df["A"] - df["B"]
df["Prod"] = df["A"] * df["B"]
df["Quot"] = df["A"] / df["B"]

2. Element-wise Operations  :

Operations are applied element by element.

Example:

df["A"] * 2     # multiply each element of column A by 2

3. Operations on Entire DataFrame  :

You can apply operations to the whole DataFrame.

Example:

df + 5   # adds 5 to all numeric elements
df * 2   # multiplies all numeric elements by 2

4. Between Two DataFrames / Series  :

Pandas aligns on row index and column names.

Example:

df1 + df2


→ Adds values where indices & columns match. Missing values become NaN.

5. Using Pandas Built-in Methods  :

add(), sub(), mul(), div() → safer than + - * / because they handle NaN better.

Example:

df["A"].add(df["B"], fill_value=0)

6. Broadcasting  :

Scalars can be used in operations.

Example:

df["A"] + 100   # Adds 100 to each element in column A
 
7. Descriptive Stats (Related)  :

Quick math summaries:

df.sum()      # column-wise sum
df.mean()     # column-wise mean
df.max()      # column-wise maximum
df.min()      # column-wise minimum
